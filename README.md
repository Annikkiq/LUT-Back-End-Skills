## Back-End-Skills

RESTful API project

## Getting Started

This is my rest api project for LUT University Software Development Skills: Back-End Anytime-course. 

### Installing

In this project I use express, nodemon, mongodb, mongoose and body-parser as dependencies. It is recommended to install nodemon globally to your system path, so you can run it by calling it from within an npm script.

```
npm install express mongodb --save
```
```
npm install -g nodemon 
```
```
npm install mongoose body-parser
```

## Running the tests

I use Postman for testing my code, www.postman.com.

### More

I have project called "rest-project", with 2 collections in it (movies and genres). In following i will show example how to get things started.

First i have to activate mongo, so i run this on my terminal:
```
sudo systemctl start mongod.service
```
Then I navigate to VScode and run this command on integrated terminal:
```
npm start
```
And i should get this as a response:
```
Listening on port 5000...
```

Then Im all ready to code! To see the my project in live action, see my YouTube reference linked above.
