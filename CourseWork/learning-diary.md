Today I started the course and went through the course information and environment setup. I watched the REST API concepts and examples YouTube-video and also some other videos of the same topic. I created a new folder for the REST API project and installed package.json and other necessary packages. I will code this project in Visual Studio Code. I also created a new Git repository for this project and downloaded Postman.

Today I started my studies by watching Node.js and Express tutorials. I installed Node.js and finished the exercise task. No updates for my own project. 

- *06.05.2020*

Today I'm continuing to learn Node.js and Express and I try to figure out how to use those in my RESTful API project. 

- *07.05.2020*

Today I’m going through MongoDB tutorial and installation. I installed Mongo to my computer and navigated to the shell. I followed through the tutorial and coded along. 

- *08.05.2020*

Today I started coding my project. I will first make a very simple web server and then, later on, add more stuff there.  I have installed express, nodemon, body-parser and mongodb to my project.

Today I continued to code my rest-project. I made a models folder and inside there I created genres.js and movies.js. I also created basic index.html and app.js files. I have some troubles whit mongodb and it takes me some time to figure out how it works.

--update I finally got my mongoDB working, it had some permission problems so I fixed those. 

- *18.05.2020*

After a small break, I will continue my course today. I created a new mongoDB database, where I can store movies and I can navigate in mongo shell.

- *22.05.2020*

Today I created routers folder and organized routers to their own files and after that, I tested that my mongo commands still worked as expected. I also wrote down some mongo shell commands, so it’s easier to remember them, but I will not include that file on GitHub. 

--update It took me some time to figure out how I can implement Express router to my project, I should have done that earlier but I was focusing on other stuff before. Now when I organized my files, I had to figure out how to import and export files correctly, so my code doesn’t break. 

- *24.05.2020*

Today I created a new SSH key and pushed my project to GitHub. I’ve been also experiencing MongoDB commands and I will add more data to my collections. 

- *26.05.2020*

Today I started to write a README and also include exercises to the main project. 

- *27.05.2020*

I noticed that I haven’t done some exercises so today I started to make them. 

- *30.05.2020*

Based on the feedback i got, i modified my code and record new sample video whit Postman and now my code should work as expected.
